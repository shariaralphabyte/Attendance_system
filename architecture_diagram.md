## Data Flow

### Employee Registration Flow
1. User accesses Add User Screen
2. System generates unique employee ID
3. User enters profile information
4. Data validated through User Service
5. Information stored in Users Table
6. Success confirmation displayed

### Attendance Marking Flow
1. User accesses QR Scanner Screen
2. QR code scanned and decoded
3. Employee ID validated
4. Settings retrieved for late time configuration
5. If dual auth enabled:
   - Navigate to Biometric Auth Screen
   - Perform biometric authentication
6. Attendance record created/updated
7. Success feedback provided

### Biometric Registration Flow
1. User accesses Biometric Registration Screen
2. Device capabilities checked
3. User guided through enrollment process
4. Biometric data captured and stored
5. Registration confirmation provided

### Settings Management Flow
1. Admin accesses Settings Screen
2. Current configuration retrieved
3. Changes made through UI controls
4. Validation performed on inputs
5. Updated settings stored
6. Confirmation provided

## Security Architecture
